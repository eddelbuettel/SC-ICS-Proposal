## Proposal: Software Carpentry R Instrutor Training 

#### The problem

> What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it
> affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should
> include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If
> you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of
> support from a member of R core.

R is in high demand - an ever increasing number of people from various
domains are keen to learn it and further improve their skills. While
there is an enormous amount of R teaching material, commercial as well
as
[freely available](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/),
qualified instructors who possess skills in R and in effective
teaching methodology, is not widely available.

#### The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions
> you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure
> modes and how will you recover from them?

We would like to organise a
[Software Carpentry instructor training](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/)
that is focused on teaching R programming:

> These instructor *training course introduces the basics of
> educational psychology and instructional design, and shows them how
> to use them to teach programming to free-range adult learners. Each
> lesson includes a theory of how people learn or a teaching
> technique, with a specific focus on applying these ideas and tools
> to computational instruction. It is necessarily shallow, but we hope
> it will be useful and convince you to learn more.*

We would like to organise the instructor training during Q2 or
Q3 2016. The exact date will be chosen so as to maximise the
participation of participants. The Software Carpentry has already
organised several instructor trainings and has accumulated substantial
experience
([1](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html),
[2 (currently 404)](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/11/december-2015-team-selection-2015-11-24.html),
[3](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/12/instructor-training-checkout-procedure.html)). We
would require participants to demonstrate good knowledge of R and,
ideally, to be familiar with Software and Data Carpentry teaching
techniques.

Need to detail how this will be R specific:
- concentrate on R modules
- could suggest to prepare/contribute and distribute to R SC/DC
  teaching material as part of the course

The online instructor training will be open (free). What format:
running over eight weeks or running over two full days? Individuals or
groups (4-6 people)? See [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/12/three-flavors-of-instructor-training.html).

What about mentoring?

#### How can the ISC help

> What can we do to help you? If you need money, how much? How will
> you spend it? We expect that most of the budget will be on people,
> but we will consider funding travel and equipment if you have good
> justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could
> we help?

We would like to request financial support from the ISC to organise
and promote the course. Possibly also with IT to run the online
course.

#### Budget

> Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are
> likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k
> projects, and handful of projects with budgets of of $5-10k. We do
> not pay overhead.

We request a budget of $10K for the organisation of the online
course. Details...

#### Dissemination

> How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
> of people? What open source license will you use? How will host your
> code so that others can contribute? How will you publicise your
> work? We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R
> consortium blog: once to announce the project, and one to write up
> what you achieved.

We will rely on the main R, Software Sustainability Institut and
Software/Data Carpentry discussion channels to advertise the
instructor course. The material is available CC-BY license; so will
any additional material prepared for this R-specific event. The names
of the newly trained instructors will be advertised widely for them to
further disseminate what they have learned. The event will broadcast
the course and its outcome broadly over social media and through blog
posts on the R consortium, Software Carpentry blogs and local
communities.
