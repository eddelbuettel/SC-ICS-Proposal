## Proposal: Software Carpentry R Instutor Training 

#### The problem

> What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it
> affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should
> include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If
> you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of
> support from a member of R core.

#### The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions
> you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure
> modes and how will you recover from them?


#### How can the ISC help

> What can we do to help you? If you need money, how much? How will
> you spend it? We expect that most of the budget will be on people,
> but we will consider funding travel and equipment if you have good
> justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could
> we help?

#### Budget

> Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are
> likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k
> projects, and handful of projects with budgets of of $5-10k. We do
> not pay overhead.

#### Dissemination

> How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
> of people? What open source license will you use? How will host your
> code so that others can contribute? How will you publicise your
> work? We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R
> consortium blog: once to announce the project, and one to write up
> what you achieved.
